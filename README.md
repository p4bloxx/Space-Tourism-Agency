### What I learned

Initially, to approach this project, I looked at the exhaustive resource I linked below, regarding the creation of a design system made especially for this project by mentor Kevin Powell, because until now I hadn't created anything like this since point of view of the size of the project, and therefore I didn't know how to carry out some parts of the project independently;

Having said that, this challenge was very important for me, precisely because I learned to create something more complex than usual, for example the creation of multiple pages, with multiple sections inside, and therefore, the next time I take up another challenge like this, I'll feel more confident doing it with less hassle and fear than this time ;)

### Useful resources

- [Create a Design System by "Kevin Powell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&t=22861s) - This resource helped me a lot, because it dealt with exactly the specific case of this challenge, initially analyzing how to create a good Design System and gradually developing the individual pages with the various sections inside, all this offered by mentor Kevin Powell who I've been following for some time ;)
